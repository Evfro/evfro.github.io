## What is this blog about
Algebraic view on problems, which is also reflected in the name of this site.
Link between pure math and practical applications.
I'm especially interested in addressing practical challenges with the help of both classic results and recent advances in pure math disciplines.

I blog mostly about recommender systems and reproducibility of research.

Here I'll write about things that I value the most in machine learning. In that sense the blog reflects my "eigen" values.
I'm also an advocate and a big fan of pure math, hence "theories".
The beauty of mathematically sound formulations fascinates me and I firmly believe that tying it with real world problems may have a great positive impact on practical solutions.
